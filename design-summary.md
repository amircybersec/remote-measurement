# Connectivity Tester: Design and Implementation Summary

## 1. Overview and Core Functionality

### 1.1 Project Purpose
The Connectivity Tester is a Go-based CLI tool designed to test and manage network connectivity through various proxy servers. The project serves two main purposes:
1. Testing and managing server connections
2. Managing and testing SOAX client vantage points

### 1.2 Core Components
The project is structured into several key packages:
- `cmd`: Contains the main CLI application
- `pkg/connectivity`: Handles connection testing
- `pkg/database`: Manages database operations
- `pkg/models`: Defines data structures
- `pkg/server`: Handles server-related operations
- `pkg/soax`: Manages SOAX client operations
- `pkg/ipinfo`: Handles IP information retrieval
- `pkg/fetch`: Provides HTTP request functionality

### 1.3 Configuration Management
- Uses Viper for configuration management
- Configuration stored in YAML format
- Supports multiple configuration paths
- Manages sensitive credentials for database and SOAX services

## 2. Server Testing Implementation

### 2.1 Server Model
```go
type Server struct {
    IP             string    `bun:",pk"`
    Port           string    `bun:",pk"`
    UserInfo       string    `bun:",pk"`
    FullAccessLink string    `bun:",unique,notnull"`
    Scheme         string    `bun:",notnull"`
    // ... other fields
}
```

### 2.2 Testing Process
1. **Initial Setup**
   - Parse server access links
   - Extract IP, port, and user information
   - Create database entries

2. **Connectivity Testing**
   - Support for both TCP and UDP protocols
   - Concurrent testing implementation
   - Error handling and reporting

3. **Result Management**
   - Database storage of test results
   - Error tracking (TCP and UDP)
   - Automatic removal of failed servers

## 3. SOAX Client Integration

### 3.1 Client Model
```go
type SoaxClient struct {
    IP             string    `bun:",pk"`
    UUID           string    `bun:",unique,notnull"`
    SessionID      int64     `bun:",notnull"`
    SessionLength  int       `bun:",notnull"`
    // ... other fields
}
```

### 3.2 Implementation Process
1. **Client Acquisition**
   - Random session ID generation
   - Dynamic URL construction
   - Unique IP verification

2. **Information Gathering**
   - SOAX checker API integration
   - IPInfo.io integration for ASN information
   - Geographic and carrier information collection

3. **Data Management**
   - Unique IP enforcement
   - Session tracking
   - Expiration time management

## 4. Database Design and Implementation

### 4.1 Schema Design
The database implementation uses the Bun ORM with PostgreSQL, featuring:
- Composite primary keys for servers
- IP-based primary keys for SOAX clients
- Automatic timestamp management
- Error tracking columns

### 4.2 Operations
1. **Server Operations**
   - Upsert functionality
   - Bulk operations support
   - Concurrent access handling

2. **Client Operations**
   - Unique IP enforcement
   - Session management
   - Partial result handling

## 5. CLI Implementation

### 5.1 Command Structure
```
connectivity-tester
├── add-servers [file]
├── test-servers [--tcp] [--udp]
└── get-clients [country] [type] [count]
```

### 5.2 Feature Implementation
1. **Server Management**
   - File-based server addition
   - Selective testing capabilities
   - Error handling and reporting

2. **Client Management**
   - Country-based client acquisition
   - Type-specific handling (residential/mobile)
   - Unique IP enforcement

### 5.3 Error Handling
- Graceful failure management
- Partial success handling
- Detailed error reporting

## 6. Process Improvements and Iterations

### 6.1 Initial Version

## 7. Future Considerations

### 7.1 Potential Improvements
1. **Scalability**
   - Database sharding
   - Distributed testing
   - Load balancing

2. **Monitoring**
   - Metrics collection
   - Performance tracking
   - Health checking

3. **Features**
   - Additional testing protocols
   - Enhanced reporting
   - API integration

### 7.2 Maintenance Considerations
1. **Database**
   - Regular cleanup of expired entries
   - Index optimization
   - Backup strategies

2. **Testing**
   - Automated testing
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Error rate monitoring

## 8. Conclusion

The Connectivity Tester project has evolved into a robust tool for managing and testing network connectivity through various proxies. The implementation prioritizes:
- Reliability through proper error handling
